            Initialising
                Controllerâ€™s applications are starting up.
            Waiting_For_PEV
                Controller is idle and ready for a plug-in.
            Negotiating_Connection
                Controller is plugged to a car and the connection is being initialised. Important charge information are
                exchanged.
            Connected_With_Full_Info
                All charge information from the PEV were retrieved and a charge session can be considered to be
                properly open.
            Insulation_Test
                Insulation of the charge cable is being tested.
            Precharge
                Charger is matching its output voltage to the present voltage of the battery.
            Waiting_For_Charge
                PEV is about to begin the actual charging.
            Charging
                Main charging loop going on.
            Ending_Charge
                A normal charge stop condition happenned and the PEV is exiting the charging loop.
            Welding_Detection
                PEV is testing if its contactors are welded.
            Closing_Communication
                PEV can unplug and charger is reinitialising in order to then go back to Waiting_For_PEV.
            CCS_Authorisation_Process
                Special state in CCS to authorise user.
            Not_Available
                Controller has been made unavailable by Sequence_Control.Start_Charge_Authorisation
